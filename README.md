## Introduction
 A brushless DC electric motor , is a synchronous motor using a direct current (DC) electric power supply. It uses an electronic 
 controller to switch DC currents to the motor windings producing magnetic fields which effectively rotate in space and which 
 the permanent magnet rotor follows. The controller adjusts the phase and amplitude of the DC current pulses to control the 
 speed and torque of the motor ,Brushless motors find applications in such places as computer peripherals (disk drives, printers), 
 hand-held power tools, and vehicles ranging from model aircraft to automobiles. In modern washing machines, brushless DC motors have
 allowed replacement of rubber belts and gearboxes by a direct-drive design
